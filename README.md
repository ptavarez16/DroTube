### Overview
This web application was built using the popular frontend framework, React.js. The app uses YouTube's API to enable users the ability to search youtube videos.

On the initial load, the app fetches trending videos on YouTube, listing the top 5 on the right side of the page. The first video on the list is displayed with an iframe ready to play along with the video's title and description.

When a user makes a search request, they are able to select between the listed videos. When a video is selected, the state of the page changes to that selection.
